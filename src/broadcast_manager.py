           degrading gracefully) — clears whichever of preferred_audio_language /

        2. A mapped subtitle stream that's a bitmap format FFmpeg's WebVTT encoder
           can't convert — disables subtitles entirely, since the failure message

        ``delete_segments`` flag, but the rolling window keeps several segments on
        disk at any time (hls_list_size × hls_time seconds), giving us a comfortable
        window to measure each file before it disappears.
