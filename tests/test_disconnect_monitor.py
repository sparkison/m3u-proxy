"""Regression test for the ASGI disconnect monitor's client cleanup.

Previously, the disconnect monitor only set the connection's cancel_event and
signaled broadcast subscribers on client disconnect — it never called
cleanup_client() itself. Removal of the stale client record was left to the
streaming generator's own post-loop code (which often can't run, since
Starlette stops iterating a generator once the client is gone) or the
periodic sweep, which only evicts a client after CLIENT_TIMEOUT seconds of
staleness and only runs every 30s. In practice this meant a client could
stay "connected" for tens of seconds after actually disconnecting — most
visible on VOD streams, where the read loop goes long enough between chunks
that it rarely gets a chance to notice cancel_event itself.

The monitor now calls cleanup_client() directly as soon as it observes the
ASGI http.disconnect message, so the client record — and thus active
client/stream counts — update immediately.
